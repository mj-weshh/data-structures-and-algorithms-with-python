# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

## Overview

This repository contains two Python scripts, `data_structures.py` and `algorithms.py`, designed to serve as quick references for fundamental data structures and algorithms in Python.

## data_structures.py
#### Contains:
Lists 
Tuples 
Sets 
Dictionaries 
Stacks and Queues 

## algorithms.py

### Sorting Algorithms
Bubble Sort 
Quick Sort

### Searching Algorithms
Binary Search 
Linear Search

## Usage

These scripts are designed for quick review and recall of common data structures and algorithms in Python. Feel free to use and modify them as needed for your own learning and reference purposes.

## Additional Algorithms

The scripts provide a foundation for key data structures and algorithms. Note that more advanced algorithms, such as depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), and tree traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder), are not covered but can be explored separately.

Happy coding!
